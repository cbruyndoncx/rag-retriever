# Aider RAG Integration Ideas

Based on the documentation, here are the main approaches available for integrating RAG output with aider:

1. Using `/run` command:
- You can use the `/run` command to execute your script and optionally add its output to the chat
- This is what you're currently doing, which works but may be less clean since all console output is shown

2. Using Python scripting:
```python
from aider.coders import Coder
from aider.models import Model

# Create coder object
coder = Coder.create(main_model=model, fnames=fnames)

# You could have your RAG script return content that you then pass to run()
rag_content = get_rag_content()  # Your RAG script
coder.run(rag_content)
```

3. Using command line with message file:
```bash
# Have your RAG script output to a file
./rag_script.sh > rag_content.txt

# Use the message file option
aider --message-file rag_content.txt your_files.py
```

Relevant documentation URLs:

- https://aider.chat/docs/usage/commands.html

The most "clean" approach would probably be either:
1. Modify your script to output to a file and use `--message-file`
2. Use the Python scripting API to integrate directly with aider
